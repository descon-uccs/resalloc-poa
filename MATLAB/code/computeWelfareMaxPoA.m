%   Description:
%   Computes the price-of-anarchy of polynomial congestion games 
%   with welfare besis obtained as linear combination of
%   {b_1(x),...,b_m(x)}, and n players
%   
%       Variable    Size        Description
%       `n`         1x1 int     Number of players
%       `B`         mxn real    Resource cost functions, each row 
%                               corresponds to a basis in {b_1(x),...,b_m(x)}
%       `f`         mxn real    Resource utility-allocation functions, each
%                               column corresponds to a different basis. For 
%                               any `j \in [m]`, column `j` of `w` and `f`
%                               are assumed to be part of the same basis
%                               pairs `b_j`.
